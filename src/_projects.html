								Academy Accelerator</a>. After that, teamwork began, which
							included a manager, a mentor, and a tester.</p>

							project card that
							included the number of hours spent on each phase of the project, a list of basic and
							additional quality
							criteria, and corrections from the mentor.</p>
						<p>Once the project was completed, the mentor checked the site for eligibility and gave
							feedback.</p>
						<p>Then the tester stepped in and tested the project on all devices, operating systems, and
							browsers. He checked if
							the grid was broken, the proportions were maintained and "rubberstamping". He took into
							account performance,
							accessibility metrics, and checked the site for content overflow.</p>
