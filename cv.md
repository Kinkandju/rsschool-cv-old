5. [Fitness center - fitness center website](https://kinkandju.github.io/fitness-centre/)
After passing the grading process, I got into the HTML Academy Accelerator. After that, teamwork began, which included a manager, a mentor, and a tester.

The manager supervised the work process, kept track of deadlines, and helped fill out a project card that included the number of hours spent on each phase of the project, a list of basic and additional quality criteria, and corrections from the mentor.

Once the project was completed, the mentor checked the site for eligibility and gave feedback.

Then the tester stepped in and tested the project on all devices, operating systems, and browsers. He checked if the grid was broken, the proportions were maintained and "rubberstamping". He took into account performance, accessibility metrics, and checked the site for content overflow.
